**Velvet Chess Engine** is a UCI chess engine written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).

Version 8.0.0 is currently ranked around 3639 Elo (Blitz) and 3537 Elo (40/15) in the Computer Chess Rating Lists (CCRL):
- [CCRL Blitz](https://www.computerchess.org.uk/ccrl/404/cgi/compare_engines.cgi?family=Velvet&print=Rating+list)
- [CCRL 40/15](https://www.computerchess.org.uk/ccrl/4040/cgi/compare_engines.cgi?family=Velvet&print=Rating+list)

In Fischer Random Chess, the single-threaded rating is around 3837 Elo:
- [CCRL 40/2 FRC](https://www.computerchess.org.uk/ccrl/404FRC)

In order to play against Velvet, you need a Chess GUI with support for the UCI protocol.

### Features

#### Configurable strength

In order to make Velvet a viable sparring partner for human players of different skill levels, its strength can be limited.
To enable this feature, set `UCI_LimitStrength` to true and adjust `UCI_Elo` to your desired Elo rating (between 1225 and 3000).

Please note that these Elo ratings might not yet correspond well to Elo ratings of human players.
A better calibration would require a lot of games against human players of different skill levels.
I recommend to experiment with different settings to find the optimal match for your current skill.

In addition, the new `SimulateThinkingTime` option allows Velvet to mimic human-like thinking times by utilizing a portion of its remaining time budget.
You can disable this feature by setting `SimulateThinkingTime` to false.

These options can be combined with the "style" settings.

#### Support for different playing styles

Velvet offers two distinct embedded neural networks, each designed to reflect a different playing style.
You can easily toggle between these styles using the `Style` UCI option to match your strategic preferences.

* **Normal Style**: The default setting, offering a balanced approach to gameplay. While Velvet is still capable of sacrifices and aggressive attacks, it places slightly more emphasis on avoiding unfavorable positions if an attack doesnâ€™t succeed, compared to the Risky style.
* **Risky Style**: This setting pushes Velvet to adopt a bolder, more aggressive approach, taking greater risks to create dynamic and challenging positions on the board.

Note: the riskier playing style comes with the downside, that the strength is reduced by around 25 Elo depending upon the opponent.

#### Multi PV Support for Analysis
Velvet can analyze multiple lines of play simultaneously to provide a deeper understanding of positions by showing the top N moves.
The number of variations can be configured using the UCI `MultiPV` option.

#### Endgame Tablebase Support
The engine supports to probe up to 7-men Syzygy tablebases to improve evaluations of endgame positions.

#### Ponder Support
Pondering allows the engine to think during the opponent's turn.
This setting is disabled by default, but can be enabled using the `Ponder` UCI option.

#### FRC and DFRC Support
Besides standard chess, Velvet also supports the variants Fischer Random Chess (FRC or Chess960) and Double Fischer Random Chess (DFRC).

#### Cross-Platform Support
Velvet binaries are available for Windows, macOS and Linux in the download section of the [releases page](https://github.com/mhonert/velvet-chess/releases) page.

#### Parallel Search
Velvet uses Lazy SMP to make use of multi-core processors.

### :inbox_tray: Download

Executables for Windows, macOS and Linux can be downloaded from the [releases page](https://github.com/mhonert/velvet-chess/releases).

### :computer: Manual compilation

Since Velvet is written in Rust, a manual compilation requires the installation of the Rust tool chain (e.g. using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)).
The installed Rust version must support the Rust 2021 Edition (i.e. v1.56 and upwards).

Then you can compile the engine using **cargo**:

```shell
cargo build --release --bin velvet
```

To compile the engine without Syzygy tablebase support (e.g. when the target architecture is not supported by the Fathom library),
you can pass the `no-default-features` flag:

```shell
cargo build --no-default-features --release --bin velvet
```
